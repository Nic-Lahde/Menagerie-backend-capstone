# Menagerie

## Introduction  

Menagerie is a React app that helps users track their exotic pet collection. It has feeding reminders, genetic records and a genetics calculator with randomly generated 
results based on real gene inheritance probability. It uses a C# API and a SQLExpress database.


## Purpose and motivation for project  

The purpose of Menagerie is to make it easier for people to keep track of large collections of exotic pets.  
The motivation behind this project is the love of animals, and recognizing the difficulty of keeping track of several animals with different feeding schedules
and complex genetic records.

## How does this application work?  

Menagerie app has several features that make managing your collection easier:  

- Users can add new pets and only the pets owner can see it.
- Pets are displayed in order of how much time before they need to be fed. 
- Users can add genes and traits to an animals record from the database as well as add completely new genes and traits.  
- Users can create hypothetical parent animals with any number of genes and traits and then calculate the offspring.
